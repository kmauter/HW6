Pass a file in this format:
v         - where v is an integer representing the number of vertices
s         - where s is an integer representing the key of the source vertex
x y z     - where x y and z are integers representing the source, destination, and weight of an edge
...       - where any number of following lines are in the x y z format
-1        - represent the end of a graph, all graphs in the file should follow this format
